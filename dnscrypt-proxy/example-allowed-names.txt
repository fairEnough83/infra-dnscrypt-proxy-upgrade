## Rules for allowing queries based on name, one per line
##
## Example of valid patterns:
##
## ads.*                    | matches anything with an "ads." prefix
## *.example.com            | matches example.com and all names within that zone such as www.example.com
## example.com              | identical to the above
## =example.com             | allows example.com but not *.example.com
## [a-z0-9\-_]*.example.com | allows *.example.com but not example.com
## *sex*                    | matches any name containing that substring
## ads[0-9]*                | matches "ads" followed by one or more digits
## ads*.example*            | *, ? and [] can be used anywhere, but prefixes/suffixes are faster
